                    Cameroon,  officially the Republic of Cameroon,
                     is a country in west-central Africa. It is bordered 
                     by Nigeria to the west and north; Chad to the northeast;
                     the Central African Republic to the east; and Equatorial Guinea,
                     Gabon and the Republic of the Congo to the south. Its coastline
                     lies on the Bight of Biafra, part of the Gulf of Guinea and the
                     Atlantic Ocean. The country is sometimes identified as West African
                     and other times as Central African, due to its strategic position
                     at the crossroads between West and Central Africa. Its nearly 25
                     million people speak 250 native languages.

                <p class="text-base font-normal text-justify">
                    The territory of present Cameroon was inhabited during the Neolithic period. Portuguese sailors reached the coast in 1472. Over the following centuries, European interests regularized trade with coastal peoples and Christian missionaries pushed inland. In the early 19th century, Modibo Adama led Fulani soldiers in a jihad in the north against non-Muslim and partially Muslim peoples and founded the Adamawa Emirates. The peoples who fled the Fulani caused a great redistribution of the population.
                    The German Empire claimed the territory as a colony in 1884 and began a constant push within. With the defeat of Germany in World War I, Cameroon became the territory of the League of Nations and was divided into French Cameroon and British Cameroon in 1919. The French carefully integrated the Cameroon economy with that of France and improved the infrastructure with investments. capital, skilled workers and continued forced labor.
                    The British managed their territory from neighboring Nigeria. The natives complained that this made them a neglected "colony of a colony". The mandates of the League of Nations were converted into United Nations Associations in 1946 and the question of independence became an urgent issue in French Cameroon. France banned the most radical political party on July 13, 1955, the Union of Peoples of Cameroon (UPC). This led to a long guerrilla warfare. In British Cameroon, the question was whether to reunite with French Cameroon or join Nigeria.
                    On January 1, 1960, French Cameroon gained independence from France under President Ahmadou Ahidjo, and on October 1, 1961, the old British northern Cameroon became part of Nigeria, while the former British southern Cameroon joined with his close to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon.
